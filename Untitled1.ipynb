Lamb Crosstini, Chicken Shahi Korma, Mutton Biriyani (not of a typical South Indian minty taste) and caramel pudding, are few of the delicacies that one must try in there. The overall experience was good. Nice place for a friendly hangout or get together.'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\\n  We took a pool side dinner package from cherishx. The setup is rely nice, considering the cost. The pool was neat and well maintained. The staff were attentive and courteous. The food was slightly a let down. The most of the items were decent, but nothing stood out. The pork chops were quite good, with the right mix of flavours. Some of the starters were lacking in salt. Same goes for the pasta. The cocktail was good and different.

If I need to review the cafe in a neat and prompt way. I'd probably say only the ambiance is the best part of this cafe. D-View cafe is surrounded by green plants and woody furniture, stretching from the facade to the side. Now moving on to food and, staff. It was just an ordinary experience. Though the food quantity and taste was not extra-ordinary, but cannot be shrugged off either. We tried lip-smacking Chicken-lollipop, spicy crispy corn, spinach-corn sandwich and, ordinary mango-chillers. Now the worst part about the cafe is the 'staff'. The staff is absolutely not courteous and very much inattentive. First preference would be given to the cafe people or their relatives! This kinda behavior and the attitude from the staff peeved us off!

It is one of their signature dishes and is a must try.\\n\\nDesserts- I tried brownie with vanilla ice cream. It was okay. Not too great.\\n\\nOverall a wonderful experience to sit with friends over good food.\\n\\ncupcakesontravel.blogspot.com\")]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
